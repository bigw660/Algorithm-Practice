There is a trap in this problem. The first thought would be DP. However, by looking at the diagram, it takes `O(n^2)` time. The insight is *finding minimum subarray sum*. Then one can improve the time to `O(n)`.
```python
def maxScore(self, cardPoints, k):
        n = len(cardPoints)
        s = t = sum(cardPoints[:n-k]) # s: subsum, t: temp

        for i in range(n-k, n):
            t += cardPoints[i]-cardPoints[i-n+k]
            s = min(s, t)

        return sum(cardPoints) - s
```
