The question is simple. It's all about counting. A small trick is to count number of odds, which can simplify the code a little bit.
```python
def longestPalindrome(self, s):
        C = collections.Counter(s)
        
        tot, odd = len(s), 0
        for x in C:
            if C[x] % 2 == 1:
                odd += 1
                
        return tot-odd+(odd>0)
```
Time: `O(N)`
