This is a practice of *finding minimum distance between two nodes in a undirected graph*. The whole point is to loop the midium node as the *first* layer of iteration.
```python
def findTheCity(self, n, edges, distanceThreshold):
        # O(n^3)
        D = [[float("inf")]*n for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(n):
            D[i][i] = 0

        for i, j, d in edges:
            D[i][j] = D[j][i] = d

        for k in range(n):
            for i in range(n):
                for j in range(n):
                    D[i][j] = min(D[i][k]+D[k][j], D[i][j])

        res, m = n, float("inf")
        for i in range(n):
            c = 0
            for j in range(n):
                if D[i][j] <= distanceThreshold and j != i:
                    c += 1
            if c <= m:
                res, m = i, c

        return res
```
