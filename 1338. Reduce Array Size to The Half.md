```python
def minSetSize(self, arr):
        # greedy
        C = collections.Counter(arr)
        C = sorted(C.values(), reverse=True)
        
        tot = 0
        for i, x in enumerate(C):
            tot += x
            if tot >= len(arr)/2:
                return i+1
```
Time: `O(n log n)` (because of sorting)

**Remark 1:** one can cheat a little bit to imporve time to `O(n)` by indexing the frequency. In shorts, use a sparse array to store the frequency so that one can avoid sorting.

**Remark 2:** in fact, personally, I like to use 0-1 Knapsack problem to look at this problem:
```python
def minSetSize(self, arr):
        # 0-1 knapsack problem
        # value: 1, weight: C[x]
        # max val with cond: weight <= len(arr)/2
        
        C = collections.Counter(arr)
        W = [0]*(len(arr)/2+1)
        
        for x in C:
            for w in range(len(W)-1, C[x]-1, -1): # reverse ord, important!
                W[w] = max(W[w-C[x]]+1, W[w])
        
        return len(C) - W[-1]
```
The only downside is it's not efficient at all...
