# optimal approach:
class Solution:
    def maximumGap(self, num):
        if len(num) < 2 or min(num) == max(num):
            return 0
        # we want to make sure those two numbers forming the maximum difference fall into separate 
        # buckets so that we do not need to worry about the numbers in the same bucket. To achieve 
        # this we want the size of each bucket to be less than the maximum difference.
        a, b = min(num), max(num)
        # Assuming md denotes the maximum difference, then we have md * (len(nums) - 1) >= b - a, 
        # so md >= (b - a) / (len(nums) - 1), since md must be integer, we get md >= math.ceil((b - a) / (len(num) - 1)), 
        # thus we make size = math.ceil((b - a) / (len(num) - 1)).
        size = math.ceil((b-a)/(len(num)-1))
        # making the number of buckets to be (b - a) // size + 1, it is guaranteed that the 
        # final bucket size is less than maximum difference hence those two numbers 
        # forming maximum difference will be in separate buckets.
        bucket = [[None, None] for _ in range((b-a)//size+1)]
        for n in num:
            b = bucket[(n-a)//size]
            b[0] = n if b[0] is None else min(b[0], n)
            b[1] = n if b[1] is None else max(b[1], n)
        # remove empty buckets
        bucket = [b for b in bucket if b[0] is not None]
        return max(bucket[i][0]-bucket[i-1][1] for i in range(1, len(bucket)))

 For a general dataset, it has to take ```O(n log n)``` to sort. If one wants better performance, one needs to utilize special structure of the dataset, for example, *non-negative integers*. In this case, we can make it ```O(n)``` by Radix sort/bucket sort.
 
 ```python
 def maximumGap(self, nums):
        # bucket sort
        
        if not nums:
            return 0
        
        b = max(nums).bit_length()
        
        i = 1
        for _ in range(b):
            zero, one = [], [] # binary bucket
            for x in nums:
                if x & i:
                    one.append(x)
                else:
                    zero.append(x)
            i = i << 1
            nums = zero + one
        
        # find the max gap
        M = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)-1):
            M = max(nums[i+1]-nums[i], M)
            
        return M
```
**Remark 1:** The last part is equivalent to the one-liner ```return max([nums[i+1]-nums[i] for i in range(len(nums)-1)])```. However, 
it is faster to use a loop because it has to generate the iterable ```[nums[i+1]-nums[i] for i in range(len(nums)-1)]``` first and then call the ```max()``` (which is ```O(n)``` to find the max.

**Remark 2:** Note that the given ```nums``` is unsorted, which means we can not find the max gap by just one pass. Sorting it is inevitable.
