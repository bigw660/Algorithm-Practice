# basic approach:
class Solution:
    def maximumGap(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) < 2:
            return 0
        nums = sorted(nums)
        res = 0
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            res = max(res, nums[i] - nums[i-1])
        return res

# optimal approach:
class Solution:
    def maximumGap(self, num):
        if len(num) < 2 or min(num) == max(num):
            return 0
        # we want to make sure those two numbers forming the maximum difference fall into separate 
        # buckets so that we do not need to worry about the numbers in the same bucket. To achieve 
        # this we want the size of each bucket to be less than the maximum difference.
        a, b = min(num), max(num)
        # Assuming md denotes the maximum difference, then we have md * (len(nums) - 1) >= b - a, 
        # so md >= (b - a) / (len(nums) - 1), since md must be integer, we get md >= math.ceil((b - a) / (len(num) - 1)), 
        # thus we make size = math.ceil((b - a) / (len(num) - 1)).
        size = math.ceil((b-a)/(len(num)-1))
        # making the number of buckets to be (b - a) // size + 1, it is guaranteed that the 
        # final bucket size is less than maximum difference hence those two numbers 
        # forming maximum difference will be in separate buckets.
        bucket = [[None, None] for _ in range((b-a)//size+1)]
        for n in num:
            b = bucket[(n-a)//size]
            b[0] = n if b[0] is None else min(b[0], n)
            b[1] = n if b[1] is None else max(b[1], n)
        # remove empty buckets
        bucket = [b for b in bucket if b[0] is not None]
        return max(bucket[i][0]-bucket[i-1][1] for i in range(1, len(bucket)))
