This is a variant of *#53. Maximum Subarray*. The main idea is DP. Maintian two numbers:
> `M`: maximum of product of `nums[:i]`
> `m`: minimum of product of `nums[:i]`

Every time we have a new element `x=num[i]`, we multiply it to `M` and `m`. The crucial oberservation is that except `0`, every number counts. However, we also need to consider the possibility that the new elemen `x` is larger than `M` or smaller than `m`, e.g.
> `[-1,2,1]`, when `i=1`, `2 > -1`
> `[2,-2,-5,-4,3]`, when `i=2`, `-5 < -4=(2*(-2))`

Therefore, we should update `M` and `m` by comparing `M*x` and `m*x` with `x` as well.
```python
def maxProduct(self, nums):
        ret = M = m = nums[0] # ret: return

        for x in nums[1:]:
            if x < 0: # the property of changing sign
                M, m = m, M

            M = max(x, M*x)
            m = min(x, m*x)

            ret = max(ret, M)

        return ret
```
Time: `O(n)`
