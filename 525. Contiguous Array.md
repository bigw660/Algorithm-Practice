This is damn *hard* if you have never saw this problem before... What you really need is *insight*: think about the meaning of "*contiguous sub array of equal 0 and 1".* We need to understand this condition properly. The main idea is:
> *if the sub array `nums[p:q+1]` has equal 0 and 1, then the increment of 1 in `nums[p:q+1]` **equals** to the increment of 0 in `nums[p:q+1]`*.

Thus all we need to do is computing the *acumulative* numbers of 1 and 0 starting from index 0 and find their difference. If the difference has shown up before, we know we find a such interval described above.

Bearing this in mind, then this problem is nothing more than *1. Two Sum*:
```python
def findMaxLength(self, nums):
        D = dict()
        D[0] = -1
        S = [0, 0] # count for 0 and 1
        res = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            S[nums[i]] += 1
            x = S[1] - S[0] # difference

            if x not in D:
                D[x] = i
            else:
                res = max(res, i-D[x])
            #A.append(S[1]-S[0]) # for debuging
        #print(A) # for debuging

        return res
```
Time: `O(n)`

**Remark:** DP with memorization can't solve the problem.
```python
def findMaxLength(self, nums):
        T = [[None]*len(nums) for _ in range(len(nums))] # T stands for table

        def f(p, q, s): #p, q refers to nums[p:q+1], s: number of 1
            if p == q:
                return 0

            if T[p][q]:
                return T[p][q]

            n = q - p + 1
            if s == n - s:
                T[p][q] = n
                return n
            else:
                T[p][q] = max(f(p+1,q,s-nums[p]), f(p,q-1,s-nums[q]))
                return T[p][q]

        return f(0, len(nums)-1, sum(nums)) if nums else 0
```
