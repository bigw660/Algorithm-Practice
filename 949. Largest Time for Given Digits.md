```python
from itertools import permutations 
class Solution:
    def largestTimeFromDigits(self, A: List[int]) -> str:
        out = ""
        # permutations(A) will generate a list of all combinations
        for i in permutations(A):
            # check if the hours and minutes are valid
            if 0 <= i[0]*10 + i[1] <=23 and 0 <= i[2]*10 + i[3] <= 59:
                # compare the string directly - according to increading order and alphabetic order
                # python will compare every character one by one
                out = max(out, str(i[0]) + str(i[1]) + ":" + str(i[2]) + str(i[3]))
        return out
```
Time complexity: O(1) (because the number of permutations would be N!N!. 
In our case, the input is an array of 4 digits. Hence, the number of permutations would 
be 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 244!=4∗3∗2∗1=24.)  
Space complexity: O(1)
