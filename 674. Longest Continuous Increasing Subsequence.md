This is the sipmlest practice in the series exercise of *increasing subsequence*. For the continuous case, namely, the *subarray* case, 2-pointer can simply solve the question.
```python
def findLengthOfLCIS(self, nums):
        if not nums:
            return 0

        q = p = 0 # p: left-pointer, q: right-pointer
        m = 0
        for q, x in enumerate(nums[1:], 1):
            if x <= nums[q-1]:
                m = max(m, q-p)
                p = q

        return max(m, q-p+1)
```
Time: `O(n)`
