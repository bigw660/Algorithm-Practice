```python
class Solution:
    def partitionLabels(self, S: str) -> List[int]:
        # make a dictionary to store the rightmost index of every character
        # the key will follow the original order of the characters
        d = {c : i for i, c in enumerate(S)}
        left, right = 0, 0
        res = []
        for i, v in enumerate(S):
            right = max(right, d[v])    
            # if i == right, it means no more same element appeared from S[:i+1] in S[i+1:]
            # now we calculate length and update left -> new staring index
            if i == right:
                res += [right - left + 1]
                left = i + 1
        return res
