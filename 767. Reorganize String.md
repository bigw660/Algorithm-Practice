The main idea is to sort by *frequency* and then insert the character into position. Using heap is the first intuition:
```python
def reorganizeString(self, S):
        # heap
        C = collections.Counter(S)
        C = [[-C[x], x] for x in C]
        heapq.heapify(C)

        if len(C) == 1 and C[0][0] < -1:
            return ""

        ret = []
        while C:
            if len(C) == 1 and C[0][0] <= -1 and C[0][1] == ret[-1]:
                return ""

            if not ret or C[0][1] != ret[-1]:
                k, x = heapq.heappop(C)
                ret.append(x)
                k += 1
                if k != 0:
                    heapq.heappush(C, [k, x])
            else:
                temp = heapq.heappop(C)
                k, x = heapq.heappop(C)
                ret.append(x)
                k += 1
                if k != 0:
                    heapq.heappush(C, [k, x])
                heapq.heappush(C, temp)

        return "".join(ret)
```
**Remark:** in fact, one can improve the code to `O(n)` by noticing one can put these characters into odd and even positions directly.
