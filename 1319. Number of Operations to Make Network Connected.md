The description is not clear. A precise version is:
> given a connection matrix `connections` of a graph `G`, find the number of moving edges so that the entire graph `G` is connected.

The main idea is DFS: finding out the connected componets. Then the answer is 
> `(n-k)+(d-1)`, namely, number of *isolated nodes* + *number of connected component-1*

**Version 1:**
```python
def makeConnected(self, n, connections):
        G = collections.defaultdict(list)
        nodes = set()
        for x, y in connections:
            G[x].append(y)
            G[y].append(x)
            nodes.update([x, y])

        def dfs(x): # return num of nodes in the coon comp
            seen[x] = 1
            res = 1
            for y in G[x]:
                if not seen[y]:
                    seen[y] = 1
                    res += dfs(y)

            return res

        c = d = 0
        seen = [0]*n
        for x in nodes:
            if not seen[x]:
                c += dfs(x) - 1 # num of edges in a conn comp
                d += 1 # num of conn comp

        m, k = len(connections), len(nodes)
        return n-k+d-1 if m-c >= n-k+d-1 else -1
```
Look at the equation closely, it is not hard to discover what we need is in fact simply
> *number of connected component-1* if we treat *isolated points* as connected component as well.

Then one can greatly simplify the code:
**Version 2:**
```python
def makeConnected(self, n, connections):
        if len(connections) < n-1:
            return -1

        G = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for x, y in connections:
            G[x].append(y)
            G[y].append(x)

        def dfs(x): # travese all the nodes
            if seen[x]: return 0

            seen[x] = 1
            for y in G[x]: dfs(y)

            return 1

        seen = [0]*n
        return sum(dfs(x) for x in range(n)) - 1
```
**Remark:**  
The performance of Version 2 is *not* better than Version 1. As Version 2 takes more calls of `dfs()` than Version 1, it may lose some time there. However, Version 2 is better than Version 1 in the sense of *clean code*.
