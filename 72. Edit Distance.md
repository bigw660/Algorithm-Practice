This is a classical DP problem. The key step of a DP programming is to *find the recursive equation*. In this problem, it is equivalent to express `dist(s,t)` in terms of substring of `s` and `t`. The trick is to *think in recursive way and implement in a iterative direction*. The rules of edit distance in fact tells us how to write down the recurssive equation. As there are three rules, we expect `dist(s,t)` depends on 
1. `dist(s,t[:-1]` -- add/del a char
1. `dist(s[:-1],t)` -- add/del a char
1. `dist(s[:-1],s[:-1]` -- replace a char
However, if `s[-1]=t[-1]`, i.e. the last characters are the same, `dist(s,t) = dist(s[:-1],t[:-1]`. In summary,
> if `s[-1]=t[-1]`, `dist(s,t) = dist(s[:-1],t[:-1])`,
> else `dist(s,t) = 1 + min(dist(s,t[:=1]), dist(s[:-1],t), dist(s[:-1],t[:-1]))`
```python
def minDistance(self, word1, word2):
        n, m = len(word1), len(word2)
        T = [[0]*(m+1) for _ in range(n+1)]
        T[0] = [i for i in range(m+1)]
        for j in range(n+1):
            T[j][0] = j

        for i, x in enumerate(word1, 1):
            for j, y in enumerate(word2, 1):
                if x == y:
                    T[i][j] = T[i-1][j-1]
                else:
                    T[i][j] = 1 + min(T[i-1][j], T[i-1][j-1], T[i][j-1])

        return T[-1][-1]
```
Time: `O(n*m)`

**Remark:** once one understand how it works, one can improve space to `O(n)`.
