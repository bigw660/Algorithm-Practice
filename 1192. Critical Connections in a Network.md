Even though one knows Tarjan's Algorithm, it is not *easy* to apply the algorithm to an *indirected graph*. First, one needs to make `par`, which represents the parent of `i`, to avoid repeating the edge `par-i`. Use a stack to maintain the nodes. Here is the implementation.

**Standard Version (also works for directed graph):**
```python
def criticalConnections(self, n, connections):
        # Tarjan's algorithm
        G = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for a, b in connections:
            G[a].append(b)
            G[b].append(a)

        self.c = 0
        nid = [None]*n # new id
        low = [None]*n
        onstack = [0]*n
        stack = []
        ret = []

        def dfs(p, i): # p: parent; i: current
            low[i] = nid[i] = self.c # assign a new id
            onstack[i] = 1 # push i in the stack
            stack.append(i)
            self.c += 1

            # dfs
            for j in G[i]:
                if nid[j] == None:
                    dfs(i, j)

                if onstack[j] and j != p: # j != p prevents use the edge j--p twice
                    low[i] = min(low[i], low[j])

            # label the right low id
            if low[i] == nid[i]: # i is the root
                while stack:
                    k = stack.pop()
                    onstack[k] = False
                    low[k] = low[i] # <-- assign the comp id/low id
                    if k == i:
                        break

            return low[i]

        dfs(None, 0)

        # detect critical connections
        for a, b in connections:
            if low[a] != low[b]:
                ret.append([a, b])

        return ret
```

As we are dealing with indirected graphs, we do not need a stack to prevent wrong low id. In fact, one can simplify the code by directly calculating the minimum. However, this only works for indirected graphs. It would be wrong to do so for *directed graphs*.

**Simplified Version:**
```python
def criticalConnections(self, n, connections):
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for v in connections:
            graph[v[0]].append(v[1])
            graph[v[1]].append(v[0])
            
        dfn = [None for i in range(n)]
        low = [None for i in range(n)]
        
        cur = 0
        start = 0
        res = []
        self.cur = 0
       
        def dfs(node,parent):
            if dfn[node] is None:
                dfn[node] = self.cur
                low[node] = self.cur
                self.cur+=1
                for n in graph[node]:
                    if dfn[n] is None:
                        dfs(n,node)
                    
                if parent is not None:
                    l = min([low[i] for i in graph[node] if i!=parent]+[low[node]])
                else:
                    l = min(low[i] for i in graph[node]+[low[node]])
                low[node] = l
                
        dfs(0,None)
        
        for v in connections:
            if low[v[0]]>dfn[v[1]] or low[v[1]]>dfn[v[0]]:
                res.append(v)
                
        return res
```

Here is a debug-challenge.
**Wrong Code:**
```python

        # Tarjan's algorithm
        G = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for a, b in connections:
            G[a].append(b)
            G[b].append(a)

        self.c = 0
        nid = [None]*n # new id
        low = [None]*n
        onstack = [0]*n
        ret = []

        def dfs(p, i): # p: parent; i: current; return the lowest id
            if nid[i] != None:
                return low[i]

            #print(i)
            low[i] = nid[i] = self.c # assign a new id
            onstack[i] = 1 # push i in the stack
            self.c += 1

            # dfs
            for j in G[i]:
                if j != p:
                    k = dfs(i, j)
                    #print(i, j, k)
                    if onstack[k]: # <-- problem here !?
                        low[i] = min(low[i], k)

            # detect critical connections
            for j in G[i]:
                if j != p and low[i] < low[j] and nid[i] < nid[j]:
                    ret.append([i, j])

            onstack[i] = 0 # pop i out the stack
            return low[i]

		dfs(None, 0)

		return ret
```
