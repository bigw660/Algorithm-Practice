This problem is **hard**. One needs to understand the spirit of *merge sort* to reach `O(n lg n)` time. However, there are some details we have not fully understood.
*Our solution*:
```python
def countRangeSum(self, nums, lower, upper):
	if not nums:
		return 0

	n = len(nums)
	psum = [0]*n
	psum[0] = nums[0]

	for i in range(1, n):
		psum[i] = psum[i-1] + nums[i]

	def merge(lo, hi): # consist with the convention [lo:hi] ~ lo <= x < hi
		mid = (lo+hi) // 2
		if lo == mid:
			return int(lower<=psum[lo]<=upper)

		c = merge(lo, mid) + merge(mid, hi)
		A = psum[lo:mid]

		i = j = mid
		for L in A:
			while i < hi and psum[i] < lower+L:
				i += 1
			while j < hi and psum[j] <= upper+L:
				j += 1
			c += (j - i)

		psum[lo:hi] = sorted(psum[lo:hi])
		return c

	return merge(0, n)
```
*Other solution*:
```python
def countRangeSum(self, nums, lower, upper):
	first = [0] # <-- why?
	for num in nums:
		first.append(first[-1] + num)
	def sort(lo, hi):
		mid = (lo + hi) / 2
		if mid == lo:
			return 0 # <-- why?
		count = sort(lo, mid) + sort(mid, hi)
		i = j = mid
		for left in first[lo:mid]:
			while i < hi and first[i] - left <  lower: i += 1
			while j < hi and first[j] - left <= upper: j += 1
			count += j - i
		first[lo:hi] = sorted(first[lo:hi])
		return count
	return sort(0, len(first))
```
The second solution passes the tests but we do not quite understand 
1. *why we need an artificial starting entry `0` for `first`?*
1. *when `mid=lo`, it means `first[lo:hi] = [first[lo]]`*, i.e. having *one* element. On top of this, why can the author ignore the counting?

**Remark:** in the discussion, the author of the second solution said `sorted()` took *linear* time. We really doubt this opinion. In fact, this should be `O(n lg n)`. However, we agree one can improve this by adding more codes to implement a *real* merge sort to reduce the time complexity from `O(n (lg n)^2^)` to `O(n lg n)`.
