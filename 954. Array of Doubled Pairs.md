The first thought is *hash table*. This is a variant of *#1. Two Sum*. Thus what we need to do is checking if `2*x` of `x/2` has been visited. If we apply the thought directly to the array `nums`, we may encounter the problem of matching when `2*x` and `x/2` are available. To solve this, we can simply sort `nums` and then apply the greedy algorithm.

**Heuristic Version:**  
```python
def canReorderDoubled(self, A):
        A.sort()
        C = collections.defaultdict(int) # counter
        S = set() # hashtable

        for x in A:
			# Greedy
            if 2*x in S:
                C[2*x] -= 1
                if not C[2*x]:
                    S.remove(2*x)
            elif x%2 == 0 and x/2 in S:
                C[x/2] -= 1
                if not C[x/2]:
                    S.remove(x/2)
            else:
                S.add(x)
                C[x] += 1

        return len(S) == 0
```
Read the code closely, in fact we can further simplify the code by combing `C` and `S` together:

**Simplified Version:**  
```python
def canReorderDoubled(self, A):
        C = collections.Counter(A)
        for x in sorted(C, key=abs): # <- key: sort by abs func
            if C[x] > C[2 * x]:
                return False
            C[2 * x] -= C[x]
        return True
```
