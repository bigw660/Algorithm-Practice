The key is that we do not need to find out all the interscetions of intervals. What we need is to keep track of the *capacity*. Follow this idea and one can see the most crucial step is *sorting*.
```python
def carPooling(self, trips, capacity):
        trips.sort(key=lambda x:x[1])
        run = []
        print(trips)

        for c, a, b in trips:
            capacity -= c

            while run and run[0][0] <= a:
                capacity += heapq.heappop(run)[1]

            if capacity < 0:
                return False

            heapq.heappush(run, (b, c))

        return True
```
In fact, one do not need an actual heap to maintain the number of passengers on the bus. Instead, one can put everything includeing loading/releasing passengers in one array and then sort:
```python
def carPooling(self, trips, capacity):
        event = []
        for n, start, end in trips:
            event.append((start, n)) # load passengers
            event.append((end, -n)) # let go passengers
        event.sort()
        pas = 0
        for a, k in event:
            pas += k
            if pas > capacity:
                return False
        return Tru
```
