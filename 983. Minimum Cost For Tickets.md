This is a typical DP question.   
**Straight-forward Version:**
```python
def mincostTickets(self, days, costs):
	# dp
	minpay = [0]*(days[-1]+1+30) # +1: day 0, +30: for i-30
	D = set(days)

	for d in range(days[0], days[-1]+1): # starts from day 1
		if d not in D:
			minpay[d] = minpay[d-1]
		else:
			minpay[d] = min(minpay[d-1]+costs[0], minpay[d-7]+costs[1], minpay[d-30]+costs[2])

	return minpay[-31]
```
**Remark:**  
One should practice an space optimal DP solution, i.e. not using `365` days but only `30` days because in fact we only trace back a 30-day window.
