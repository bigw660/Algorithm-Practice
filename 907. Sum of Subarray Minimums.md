This problem should be attributed to *hard*. It is impoosible to solve it by brute force. Naturally, DP is the first thought. However, the time is `O(n^2)` 
```python
def sumSubarrayMins(self, A):
	# dp: O(n^2)
	n, tot = len(A), 0
	M = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)] # M[i][j] records the minimum of A[i:j+1]

	for i in range(n):
		M[i][i] = A[i]
		tot += M[i][i]

	for k in range(1, n):
		for i in range(n-k):
			j = i + k
			M[i][j] = min(M[i+1][j], M[i][j-1])
			tot += M[i][j]

	return tot % 1000000007
```
Looking at the problem colsely, the problem is equivalent to *find the first smaller number on the left and the first number on the right*. By using stacks, we can improve the time to `O(n)` with *two* passes.
```python
def sumSubarrayMins(self, A):
	# stack: O(n)
	A = [0] + A + [0]
	n = len(A)
	stack, left = [-2], [0]*n
	tot = 0

	for k, x in enumerate(A[-3::-1], 3):
		while stack and x < A[stack[-1]]:
			i = stack.pop()
			left[i] = (n+i) - (n-k) - 1
		stack.append(-k)

	stack = [1]
	for k, x in enumerate(A[2:], 2):
		while stack and x <= A[stack[-1]]:
			i = stack.pop()
			a, b = left[i], k-i-1
			tot += A[i]*(1 + a + b + a*b)
		stack.append(k)

	return tot % 1000000007
```
**Remark:** the question is: can we improve to `O(n)` within *one* pass?
