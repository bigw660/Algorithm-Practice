This is also a standard DP question. The trick is to relate a 2-dimensional array to the intervals we consider, i.e. `cost[i][j]` represent the subproblem of `cut[i:j]`.
```python
def minCost(self, n, cuts):
        # dp
        cuts = [0] + sorted(cuts) + [n]
        m = len(cuts)
        cost = [[0]*m for _ in range(m)]

        for k in range(2, m):
            for i in range(m):
                j = i + k
                if j >= m:
                    continue
                cost[i][j] = (cuts[j]-cuts[i]) + min(cost[i][s] + cost[s][j] for s in xrange(i+1, j))

        return cost[0][m-1]
```
**Remark:**  
This type of DP involves the equation 
> `A[i][j] = min(A[i][s]+A[s][j) + C[i][j]`. 

One can improve time from `O(n^3)` to `O(n^2)` by *Knuth's optimization*.
