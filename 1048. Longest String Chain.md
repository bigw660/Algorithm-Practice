It is a graph problem. As it is asking about the *longest* chain, it is natural to use DFS.
```python
def longestStrChain(self, words):
        G = collections.defaultdict(set)
        seen = set()

        for x in words:
            G[len(x)].add(x)
        #print(G)

        ret = 0
        for k in list(G):
            stack = [w for w in G[k] if w not in seen]
            while stack:
                cur = stack.pop()
                s = len(cur)
                #print(cur)

                ret = max(ret, s-k+1)
                for x in G[s+1]:
                    if x not in seen and any([x[:i]+x[i+1:]==cur for i in range(s+1)]):
                        stack.append(x)
                        seen.add(x)

        return ret
```
**Remark:** look at the code closely, it is not hard to realize it is recursion + memorization, which is equivalent to *DP*. Thus, one can rewrite a *bottom-up DP* to further optimize the code.
