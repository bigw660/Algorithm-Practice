The only thing you have to be careful is the division. `a/float(b)` will give you the right division and `int(a/float(b))` will turn the float into an integer.
```python
def evalRPN(self, tokens):
        stack = []
        
        for x in tokens:
            print(x)
            if x in {"+", "-", "*", "/"}:
                a = stack.pop()
                b = stack.pop()
                if x == "+":
                    b += a
                elif x == "-":
                    b -= a
                elif x == "*":
                    b *= a
                elif x == "/":
                    b = int(b/float(a)) # little thing to be careful of
                
                stack.append(b)
            else:
                stack.append(int(x))
                
        return stack[-1]
```
