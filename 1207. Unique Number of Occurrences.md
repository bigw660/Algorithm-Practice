The idea is pretty straight forward. Use `collections.Counter` to count the frequency first, and then use `collections.Counter` to count the frequency of frequencies.
```
def uniqueOccurrences(self, arr):
        C = collections.Counter(arr)
        V = C.values()
        
        C = collections.Counter(V)
        for x in C.values():
            if x > 1:
                return False
            
        return True
```
Time: `O(n)`  
Space: `O(n)`

**Remark:** is there `O(n)` and `O(1)` solution?
