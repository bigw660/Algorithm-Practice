Hard question is *hard*. Our idea is to observe the variation of `val` and find the longest *mountain*, namely 
> a substring `s[i:j]` such that `s[i]=s[j]` and `s[k]>=s[i]` for every `i<=k<=j`

The subtlety of this problem is every time *we find `val<0`, we reset `stack` and `val`*.
```python
def longestValidParentheses(self, s):
        val, m = 0, 0
        stack = [(0, -1)] # (val, ind)

        for i, x in enumerate(s):
            if x == "(":
                val += 1
            else:
                val -= 1

            if val < 0: # reset
                val = 0
                stack = [(0, i)]

            found = False
            while stack and stack[-1][0] > val:
                found = True
                stack.pop()

            if found: # only look up stack if we pop out elm in stack
                j = stack[-1][1]
            else:
                j = i

            m = max(m, i-j)

            if val > stack[-1][0]: # maintain the stack as an accending stack
                stack.append((val, i))

        return m
```
Time: `O(n)`

One can improve the code by combining the `while` loop and `for` loop as one iteration.

**Recommended Solution:**
```python
def longestValidParentheses(self, s):
        stack, result = [(-1, ')')], 0
        for i, paren in enumerate(s):
            if paren == ')' and stack[-1][1] == '(':
                stack.pop()
                result = max(result, i - stack[-1][0])
            else:
                stack += (i, paren),
        return result
```
