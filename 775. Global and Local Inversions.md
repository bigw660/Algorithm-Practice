Here we present an `O(n)` method to find *explicit* number of global inversions (though it is not necessasry for this problem). The whole idea is to sum two countings. 
1. if `A[i] > i`: there are at least `A[i] - i` number of gloal inversions because any number in `A[i: A[i]]` is in position after `A[i]`.
2. if `A[i] > i`: we also need to count the numbers that have not shown up before `i`, which means they will be in position after `A[i]`.
3. if `A[i] <= i`: we can skip counting in 1.
4. if `A[i] <= i`: we need to count the numbers that have not shown up before `A[i]`

Once we have this idea, we use `s` to keep track of numbers of elements haven't shown up before `i` and use `count` to keep track of the counting for later use.
```python
def isIdealPermutation(self, A):
        n = len(A)
        
        locinv = gloinv = 0
        seen = [0]*n
        count = [0]*n # record of s
        s = 0 # number of elm < i
        
        for i, x in enumerate(A):
            seen[x] = 1
            if x < i:
                s += seen[x] # key to make the counting in O(n)
            
            # note that s is the number of elm before i, so we record s first then add seen[i] to it
			count[i] = s 
            s += seen[i] 
            
            if x > i: # case 1. and case 2.
                a, b = (i-count[i]), x-i
            else: # case 3. and case 4.
                a, b = x-count[x], 0
    
            gloinv += a + b           
            
            if i+1 < n and A[i] > A[i+1]:
                locinv += 1
        
        return locinv == gloinv
```
**Remark:** here we utilize the assumption that	`A` is a permutation of `[0,1,...,n-1]` to make the time in `O(n)`. If `A` is given as a general array, the best we can do is by using *divide-and-conquer/merge sort* to find number of global inversions in `O(n lg n)`.
