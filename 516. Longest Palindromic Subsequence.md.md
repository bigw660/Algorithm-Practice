The main idea is DP. Denote `f(i,j)` the solution of the substring `s[i:j+1]`. Then, it is easy to see that 

> `f(i,j)=f(i+1,j-1)+2`, if `s[i]==s[j]`  
> `f(i,j)=max(f(i,j-1), f(i+1,j))`, otherwise.

**Recursion + Memorization**
```python
def longestPalindromeSubseq(self, s):
        # recursion
        n = len(s)
        P = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]

        def find(i, j):
            if P[i][j] or i > j:
                return P[i][j]

            if i == j:
                P[i][j] = 1
            elif s[i] == s[j]:
                P[i][j] = find(i+1, j-1) + 2
            else:
                P[i][j] = max(find(i+1, j), find(i, j-1))

            return P[i][j]

        return find(0, len(s)-1)
```

**Bottom Up**
```python
def longestPalindromeSubseq(self, s):
        # dp
        n = len(s)
        #P = collections.defaultdict(int) # <-- hasing is slow!
        P = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]

        for k in range(n):
            for i in range(n-k):
                j = k + i
                if i == j:
                    P[i][j] = 1
                elif s[i] == s[j]:
                    P[i][j] = P[i+1][j-1] + 2
                else:
                    P[i][j] = max(P[i+1][j], P[i][j-1])

        return(P[0][n-1])
```

**Remark 1:** normally, bottom up dp is faster than recurion + memorization. However, in this case, recursion + memorization is faster because actually we do not need to know *all* information of the substrings.

**Remark 2:** using `dict` here is *slow* because hashing is slower than direct index/key accessing.

**Remark 3:** in fact one can improve the space complexity to `O(n)` by observing the diagonal updating closely.

Time: `O(n^2)`
Space: `O(n^2)1
