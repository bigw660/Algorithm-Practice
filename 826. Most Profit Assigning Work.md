The problem would become easy if one sorts all the inputs.
```python
def maxProfitAssignment(self, difficulty, profit, worker):
        # sort + 2-pointer
        worker.sort()
        job = sorted(zip(difficulty, profit))

        p = M = res = 0
        for ability in worker:
            while p < len(job) and job[p][0] <= ability:
                M = max(M, job[p][1])
                p += 1

            res += M

        return res
```
