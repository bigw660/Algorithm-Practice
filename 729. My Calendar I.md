Inspired by *715. Range Module*, we can use binary search to solve this problem. The whole point is to use a *1-dimensional array* to record the intervals.
```python
class MyCalendar(object):

    def __init__(self):
        self.events = []

    def book(self, start, end):
        a = bisect.bisect_right(self.events, start)
        b = bisect.bisect_left(self.events, end)

        if a == b and a % 2 == 0:
            self.events[a:b] = [start, end]
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
