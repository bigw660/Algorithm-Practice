This problem should be attributed to **Hard**. The main idea is to find two non-decreasing subarrays from the left end and the right end and then *merge* them to find the maxmimum sequence over all possible combinations. We use two stacks to keep track of these two non-decreasing subarrays.
```python
def findLengthOfShortestSubarray(self, arr):
        # 2 stacks

        n = len(arr)
        arr = [0] + arr + [float("inf")]
        A, B = [], []
        p, q = 1, len(arr)-2 #p: left end, q: right end 

        M = 0 
        while p <= q:
            if arr[p-1] <= arr[p]:
                A.append(arr[p])
                p += 1
            elif arr[q] <= arr[q+1]:
                B.append(arr[q])
                while A and A[-1] > B[-1]: # pop out numbers in A to merge
                    A.pop()
                q -= 1
            else:
                break

            M = max(M, len(A)+len(B))

        return n - M 
```
Time: `O(n)`  
**Remark:** One should try two more test cases: `[1,2,3,4,5,10,1,6,7,8,9,10]` and `[1,2,3,10,0,7,8,9]` to further verify one's code is correct.
