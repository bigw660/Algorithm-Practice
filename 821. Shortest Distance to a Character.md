The idea is to use the return `res` as a stack. Update the distance everytime we encouter a `C`. Check the head character. If is is `C`, we only need to update half range of the stack; if it's not, we update the whole stack. Due to the natural of the approach, it takes care of the last segment beyond the last `C`.
```python
def shortestToChar(self, S, C):
        res = [0]*len(S)
        S  = S + " " # artificial end to simplify the code
        
        for i, x in enumerate(S[:-1]):
            if x != C:
                res[i] = res[i-1] + 1
            else:
                j = i - res[i-1] 
                if j >= 0 and S[j-1] == C:
                    for k in range(1, res[i-1]//2+1): # only update half of the range
                        res[i-k] = k
                elif j >= 0 and S[j-1] != C:
                    for k in range(1, res[i-1]+1):
                        res[i-k] = k
                        
        return res
```

Time: `O(n)`
