This is an array question and stack is the first thought.
```python
def asteroidCollision(self, asteroids):
        # stack
        stack, res = [], []

        for x in asteroids:
            if x > 0:
                stack.append(x)
            else:
                while stack and stack[-1] < abs(x):
                    stack.pop()

                # handle the case stack[-1] = abs(x)
                if stack:
                    if stack[-1] == abs(x):
                        stack.pop()
                else:
                    res.append(x)

        return res + stack
```
Time: `O(n)` 

**Remark:**  
One can use `while: else` to simplify the grammer a little bit, but the price is to use `continue` and `break` which is not preffered in C/C++ style
