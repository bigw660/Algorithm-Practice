This is a variant of [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/). Use a hashtable to keep track of seen numbers.
```python
def checkIfExist(self, arr):
        S = set()
        
        for x in arr:
            if (x%2 == 0 and x/2 in S) or 2*x in S:
            #if x/2 in S or 2*x in S: # <-- not valid for python/python 2 but good for python 3
                return True
            else:
                S.add(x)
                
        return False
```
