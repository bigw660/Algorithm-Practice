This is a very classical question. Our first intuition is to transfer the problem to a *max profit of stock*, namely, tracing the running sum of the array and find the maximum of the stock.
```python
def maxSubArray(self, nums):
        S = lo = 0 # lo: lowest point
        M = -float("inf") # start from the most negative point

        for x in nums:
            S += x
            M = max(M, S-lo)
            if S < lo:
                lo = S

        return M
```

The second approach is DP. Transfer the problem to *find the minimum sum starting from index 0 and subtract it from the partial sum `S`*. The subtleties are
1. set the maximum `M` as `-float("inf")` initially.
1. make the comparison `M = max(M, S-m)` before adjusting the minimum sum starting from index 0 `m` later.
```python
def maxSubArray(self, nums):
        S = m = 0
        M = -float("inf") # <- crucial!

        for x in nums:
            S += x
            M = max(M, S-m) # <- need to do first
            m = min(m, S)

        return M
```

**Remark:** the solution in the book *Elementary of Programming Interviews in Python* has a little bug. Initializing `M` as `0` will cause problems e.g. `nums = [-2,-1]` turns out to be `-1` but the program will give you `0`.
