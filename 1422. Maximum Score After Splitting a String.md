This problem is tricky. It is not hard to do it by *two-pass*. However, it needs some extra observation to accomplish in *one-pass* and `O(1)` space.
```python
def maxScore(self, s):
        # two-pass
        n = len(s)
        D = {"11": 1, "10":0, "01":2, "00": 1}
        A, B = [0]*n, [0]*n
        
        if n == 2:
            return D[s]
        
        c = 0
        for i, x in enumerate(s):
            if not int(x):
                c += 1
            A[i] = c
            
        c = 0
        for i, x in enumerate(s[::-1]):
            if int(x):
                c += 1
            B[n-1-i] = c
         
        ret = max([A[i]+B[i] for i in range(1, n-1)])
        return ret 
```
Time: `O(n)`  
Space: `O(n)`
