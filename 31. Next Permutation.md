The insight is to spot the *going up backward subarray* `A` from the end, e.g. `[2,5,4,3]` having the going up backward subarray `[5,4,3]`. Once we have `A`, reverse that because that is the rule of getting next permutation. Last step: swap `2` in the previous example with the least greater element in `A[::-1]=[3,4,5]`, which is `3` in this case. Hence, we obtain the answer `[3,1,4,5]`.
```python
def nextPermutation(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        for i in range(-1, -n-1, -1):
            if i > -n and nums[i-1] < nums[i]:
                break
            elif i == -n: # last lexical permutation
                nums.reverse()
                return
        
        nums[i:] = nums[i:][::-1] # reverse the partial order
        
        # use binary search to find the swap spot
        j = bisect.bisect_right(nums[i:], nums[i-1]) # j starts from 0
        nums[i-1], nums[i+j] = nums[i+j], nums[i-1]
        return
```
**Remark:**  
We use *binary search* to speed up the search. Linear search is also good.
```python
for j in range(i, 0):
	if nums[i-1] < nums[j]:
		nums[i-1], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i-1]
		return
```
It is just slightly slower than the binary search.
