The idea is not so hard, but the implementation is *tediously hard*. The difficulty lies in the edge case. Use *2-pointer* to solve the problem:
```python
def equalSubstring(self, s, t, maxCost):
	n = len(s)
	costs = [abs(ord(s[i])-ord(t[i])) for i in range(n)] + [float("inf")]

	p = q = 0
	ret, cur = 0, costs[p]
	while q < n:
		if cur <= maxCost:
			q += 1
			cur += costs[q]
		else: # cur >= maxCost:
			ret = max(ret, q-p)
			if q == p:
				q += 1
				cur = costs[q]
			else:
				cur -= costs[p]
			p += 1

	return max(ret, q-p)
```
**Remark:**
1. The trick is to use an *artificial end* to simplify the code.
1. One can improve the space to `O(1)` by using using `s` and `t` directly.
1. One can replace the `while` loop by a `for` loop`.
