The idea is easy. For each possible sum, we check the numbers of rows that have exactly the same sum in their paritial sums. Naive approach:
```python
def leastBricks(self, wall):    
        H, W, T = len(wall), set(), []
        ind, res = [0]*H, 0
        
        for i in range(H):
            temp = set()
            for j in range(len(wall[i])-1):
                temp.add(wall[i][j])
                wall[i][j+1] += wall[i][j]
            T.append(temp) # hash table for each row
            W |= temp # all possible sums
        
        for w in W:
            c = 0
            for i in range(H):
                if w in T[i]:
                    c += 1
            res = max(res, c)
                    
        return H - res
```
Once we realize the idea, we can simply the code by using a `dict` to keep track of the partial sums so that we can reduce to *one-pass*.
