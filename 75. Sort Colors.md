This is a classical problem about manipulating (more than 2) pointers. The main idea is to maintian three pointers:
1. `sm`: *smaller pointer* points to the end of subarray which has values `<` `p`, the pivot value
1. `eq`: *equal pointer* points to the end of subarry which has values `=` `p`
1. `lg`: *larger pointer* points to the end of subarry which has values `>` `p`

The subtlety is the meaning of *end* of a subarry. By convention, this refers to the __*next*__ position of the actual end, e.g. the end of `[0,1,2]` is `3` not `2`. We can also assign the actual end to the pointer if we like.

**Standard Version:**  
```python
def sortColors(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        sm = eq = 0
        lg = n

        while eq < lg: # <- strictly less
            if nums[eq] < 1:
                nums[sm], nums[eq] = nums[eq], nums[sm]
                sm += 1
                eq += 1
            elif nums[eq] == 1:
                eq += 1
            else:
                lg -= 1
                nums[lg], nums[eq] = nums[eq], nums[lg]
```

**Second Version:**  
If we use the second convention, we need to adjust a little bit:
```python
def sortColors(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        sm = eq = 0
        lg = n - 1 # actual end

        while eq <= lg: # need less and equal
            if nums[eq] < 1:
                nums[sm], nums[eq] = nums[eq], nums[sm]
                sm += 1
                eq += 1
            elif nums[eq] == 1:
                eq += 1
            else:
                nums[lg], nums[eq] = nums[eq], nums[lg]
                lg -= 1 # need to process later
```

**Challenge:**  
Write a routine to solve `k` color sort.
